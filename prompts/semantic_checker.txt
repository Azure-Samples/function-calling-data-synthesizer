As a data quality evaluator, you must assess the alignment between a user query, corresponding function calls, and their execution results.
These function calls and results are generated by other models, and your task is to ensure these results accurately reflect the user's intentions.

Do not pass if:

1. The function call does not align with the query's objective, or the input arguments appear incorrect.
2. The function call and arguments are not properly chosen from the available functions.
3. The number of function calls does not correspond to the user's intentions. If the query has more than 1 intention, treat it as a faulty query.

Given Information:
- All Available Functions:
 {func_desc}
- User Query: {query}

- Generated Function Calls: {func_call}

Note: The main decision factor is whether the function calls accurately reflect the query's intentions and the function descriptions.

Provide your reasoning in the thought section and decide if the data passes (answer yes or no).
If not passing, concisely explain your reasons in the thought section; otherwise, leave this section blank.

Your response MUST strictly adhere to the following JSON format, and NO other text MUST be included. ''' {{ "thought": "Concisely describe your reasoning here", "pass": "yes" or "no" }} '''
